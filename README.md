# 11-Note-Taker

## Description

This application takes user input in the form of a note with a title and stores it in a json db file. This file is then used by the front end to populate the interface. This was a very useful exercise to help me understand the relationship between front end and back end, get and post requests as well as the way to use them.

## Installation

No installation, simply view my heroku deploy link here:
